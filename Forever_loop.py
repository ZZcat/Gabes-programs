#When I say int that stands for integer and str stands for a string
number = 0 #makes a variable called number that = 1
mood = raw_input("How are you doing ") #asks for user input and makes it a str
##remember to use input() for int(numbers) and raw_input for everything else
while number == 0: ##this says while number = 1 run the code in the following tabs
        ## remember to use = for define a variable and == for reading the variable
	print "You were doing" , mood
	mood = raw_input("How are you doing now? ")
